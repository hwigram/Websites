 
i.Interest of content
Generally the information provided on the website is interesting and informative. For me, the page about the computer sciences' influence in sport is very interesting and depicts different ways in different sports. This is backed up with some revelent evidence and good images. On the other hand, the page about self driving cars is a little light on information and thus is less capturing and intriguing. Despite the inclusion of links to other pages with more information, the individual could have padded out their page better. 
VERY GOOD


ii.Consistency and quality of visual presentation
I thought that the quality of visual presentation on the hub page was exceptional, to include a full background image makes the page look very professionl. However it lacks consistency due to the other pages having plain white backgrounds. This creates a contrast of white writing on a black background and then black writing on a white background. In addition, the use of images is very successful. 
CONSISTENCY - SOUND
QUALITY - EXEMPLARY


iii.Quality of written presentation
On the website is lots of varied information which creates an interest read. The quality in general is very good. 
EXCELLENT


iv.Validity of HTML
The HTML in general looks valid. One possible error is on the hub page when the make the list, after each item in the list they do not close the list tag. Despite this, everything else appears correct.
OUTSTANDING


v.Evidence of collaboration including

◾Author info not written by author
All the author info was written by different people than who wrote the page
EXEMPLARY
◾Balanced contributions from members
Each member wrote a single webpage, however one webpage seemed to lack in information than the other two, making the contributions slightly unbalanced.
VERY GOOD
◾Not completed at the last minute
Most completed nice and early however some things had to be changed at the last minute. 
GOOD
